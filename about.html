                <div class="secondary-font">
                <p>Black Estate has three organic vineyard sites lie on north facing hillsides of Omihi, north Canterbury. They comprise various limestone, clay and sandstone soils.  

                    We believe that healthy soils is the obvious foundation for quality, so we farm to give back to the land, regenerate life and nurture the existing life in the soils, plants and wildlife in each vineyard.
                    
                    Each vineyard is certified organic with BioGo. Organics means we avoid using systemic sprays on our land.
                    
                    When it comes to winemaking, we want to make true and uncluttered wines that express the character of each farm.

                <div class="secondary-font">
                <p>We are a family owned business dedicated to producing the best quality and most delicious wine. 

                    Nicholas and Pen are married with two children, Sylvia and Arthur who have grown up at the Home and Netherwood vineyards.  
                    <br><br>Nicholas looks after our three vineyards and makes our wines with his team.  Pen manages the business and looks over the restaurant and cellar door with another great team.
                     Since 2007, when we first purchased the Home Vineyard from Russell Black, Pen’s parents and siblings have supported us with investing in the land here.  Pen’s father Rod, is a 5th generation horticulturalist from North Otago, (Rod’s family grew the first table grapes NZ!). <br><br>
                     Pen’s mum Stacey provides much cheer and family support along with Nicholas’ parents who help out so much.  Jo and Cam, Pen’s siblings are energetic supporters.
                    Russell and Kumiko Black planted the original Black Estate Pinot Noir and Chardonnay vines in 1993, at what is now called the Home Vineyard.  We purchased that property from Russell in 2007, keeping the name.  We then went on to purchase Damsteep Vineyard from the Hull family in 2012 and Netherwood Vineyard from them in 2015. <br><br>
                    Netherwood was originally established by Danny Schuster and Russell Black in 1986.
                    This dream is only possible with our staff.  Somehow, each person in our team has followed a path to join us here and we are very grateful.
